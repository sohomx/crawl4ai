The notebook provides a step-by-step guide for using crawl4ai, a web crawling library, focusing on what it does (web crawling), why it is used (to gather data from websites efficiently), and how it is implemented (through the WebCrawler class). The technical process begins with installing the library from a GitHub repository. After installation, the notebook imports the necessary components, including the WebCrawler class, which is initialized to start the crawling process. The library relies on aiohttp, aiosqlite, beautifulsoup4, fastapi, and other dependencies for asynchronous operations, data handling, and efficient crawling. The output logs confirm the initialization of the crawling strategy.
